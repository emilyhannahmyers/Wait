_Objective_<br />
Create a sound project inspired by time.  A wide range of approaches may be taken, from the abstract to the representational.  Sound, video, animation, and/or student’s choice of programming.  May be abstract or representational.

_Abstract_<br />
Wait is based around the idea that the viewer’s perception of time is entirely alterable by the artist.  In this piece, I created the most minimal interactions possible and still maintain the interest of the viewer.  A neutral color palatte was used to add to the minimal theme.

The software used is Adobe Flash CS5.5, and with this, I created what seems to be an incredibly interactive piece of art.  In reality, however, the “interactivity” will all be false suggestions of interactive options.  For example, the very beginning will display a blank screen that reads, “Wait” with a start button.  The start button will be set to run the program ten seconds after the first click by the user, almost forcing them into multiple clicks of the button.

Once they are actually inside the program, there will be a box that is slowly rotating in the upper left hand corner.  Nothing else will be on the screen, since my concept deals with the minimum requirements for maintaining concentration over time.  However, the mouse cursor will have some sort of movement near it to suggest that the viewer can use the mouse to make things happen inside the frame.  Unfortunately for the user’s patience, the mouse clicks will do nothing of real importance.  Slight, very subtle changes may be made, such as increasing the speed of the spinning box, altering the color of the clicked item by a tiny amount, or editing the amount of time the user will spend in this particular stage.

Other stages I’m considering adding later includes a rotating triangle after the user hits twenty/fifty clicks of the mouse button, suggesting that they can add more items if they click more (they won’t, and it will hopefully be frustrating).  The mouse clicks may or may not do anything to the speed or the color of the objects, but the idea is that the user would trick herself into thinking that the clicks are causing a change.  Overall, I’d like this piece to mess with the user’s mind, and ultimately, perception of time.
